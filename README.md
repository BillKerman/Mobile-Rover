# Mobile-Rover
WiFi-controlled 6-wheeled rover inspired by Chandrayaan 3â€™s Pragyan. Features a rocker-bogie suspension for exceptional obstacle traversal, including stair climbing. Uses ESP32 for remote control and L298N motor drivers for precise maneuverability. Ideal for rough terrain payload delivery.
