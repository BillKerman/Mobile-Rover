#Mobile Rover

 Developed a WiFi-controlled 6-wheeled rough terrain rover with a rocker-bogie suspension system, inspired by Chandrayaan
3â€™s Pragyan rover. Engineered for delivering payloads in rough terrains, it demonstrates exceptional obstacle traversal,
including the capability to climb stairs. Integrated ESP32 and L298N motor drivers for precise remote control capabilities.
We used Blynk IOT platform for enabling remote control from anywhere on the planet with internet.
